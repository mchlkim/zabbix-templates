# Zabbix Templates

This repository contains community-driven templates for Zabbix monitoring. Each template resides in its own directory with an importable YAML and accompanying documentation.

Available templates:

- [AWS STS by HTTP](cloud/AWS/aws_sts_http/README.md)
- [AWS VPN by HTTP](cloud/AWS/aws_vpn_http/README.md)

Use the README in each template directory for setup instructions.
